# Session: BitburnerBotnet
Updated: 2026-02-07T15:41:57Z

## Goal
Preserve a minimal continuity ledger so future sessions can resume work on the BitburnerBotnet repository (success = this file exists and lists next steps, decisions and key files).

## Constraints
- Keep the ledger concise and focused on WHAT and WHY (not implementation details).
- Include git branch and key file paths. Mark uncertain items as UNCONFIRMED.

## Progress
### Done
- [x] Created initial continuity ledger file.

### In Progress
- [ ] Gather and record critical context (package.json, README, src/, config files) — awaiting confirmation which files to authoritatively capture.

### Blocked
- None currently.

## Key Decisions
- **Session name = BitburnerBotnet**: chosen from repository name for clarity.
- **Ledger stored under thoughts/ledgers/**: keeps continuity artifacts together.
- **Minimal scope**: only essential context will be recorded to avoid bloat; additional details will be added on request.

## Next Steps
1. Confirm which files to snapshot into Critical Context (I suggest: package.json, README.md, src/, any build/config files).

## File Operations
### Read
- None recorded (no repository files were read to create this initial ledger).

### Modified
- `thoughts/ledgers/CONTINUITY_BitburnerBotnet.md`

## Critical Context
- Repo root: /Users/chof64/Developer/BitburnerBotnet
- Current branch: `main` (verified).
- No previous continuity ledger was found in thoughts/ledgers/ (verified). UNCONFIRMED: list of project entry points and important configs — recommend capturing package.json, README.md, src/ and any scripts or CI configs.

## Working Set
- Branch: `main`
- Key files: `thoughts/ledgers/CONTINUITY_BitburnerBotnet.md`, `package.json` (UNCONFIRMED), `README.md` (UNCONFIRMED), `src/` (UNCONFIRMED)
